Sent via email Matter:
Hi Kathryn and Sue,


Thank you, for providing high quality health care in the Binghamton area.
Thank you, also, for receiving me (aka via Medical office window) at
the Lourdes Center for Psychiatry (184 Court St., Binghamton, NY
13901) this thanksgiving week (aka friday). I check in at the medical
office window every week to fulfill my health care needs.


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


Unfortunately, my request (just as in the past weeks) with the medical
office window, for urgent medical service transport to Lourdes
hospital, led to unpleaseant behaviour (aka non medical) by the
operating individual (aka Jim). To be precise, I was exposed to Cops
(aka Poor lice) and was asked to leave the premises (aka Lourdes
Center for Psychiatry, 184 Court Street, Binghamton, NY 13901). I
provided accurate medical information, that I was unable to secure
urgent medical service transport (aka Medical van; aka Medical
minivan; aka Medical cab) on my own, from urgent medical service
transport providers operating in the Binghamton area.


I am requesting you to provide urgent medical service transport and/or
contract urgent medical service transport with private providers
operating in the area, for urgent medical care at Lourdes Hospital and
at Lourdes Affiliates (aka contracted to provide urgent medical care).


I have a personal preference for Resident urgent medical service
transport provider's (aka fresh graduates who are in residence
training). I also have a gender preference - female (who have
identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). It would be great, to be able to
perform conflict of interest and compatibility check's.


It would be wonderful, if you are able to deliver urgent medical
service transport and urgent medical care.


I look forward to hearing from you, at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
