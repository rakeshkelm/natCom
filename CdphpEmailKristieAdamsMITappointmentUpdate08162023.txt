PS: Please forward to Tory - Peer Specialist, GBHC


Thanks,


Kristie for scheduling pick up and ride. I enjoyed, the second half
of the ride (Louisa just driving, without any talking - direct or
cross talk). It would be great if GBHC, allows you folks to keep the
ride, that way both going in and coming back. I pray to the lord
every day, that you all, should be allowed to give quiet ride's.


After, the in-coming ride, I had a conversation with Louisa at a table
in the cafe area across from the bowling lanes. Louisa, informed me
that she does not have twenty minutes to spare, for me to go check-in
at the window at CTRC and have a conversation with you. Hence, she
brought me back home (with some cross talk). I prefer silence while I
am in the car.


I made the following request's, to Louisa and I am going to share the
request's, with you, in writing.
1. Please, forward a copy of the referral to me (Rakesh Kukatla).
2. Request to speak with a Social worker (Degree'd - MS, BS and License'd).
3. Request rides from Social worker (Degree'd - Associates and License'd).
4. Please, share profile of Social worker and/or perform
Compatibility and Conflict of interest check's prior to scheduling
appointment's (Degree'd - MBA and Licensed)


Thanks again,
Independent interest and Militia
